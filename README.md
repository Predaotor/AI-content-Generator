🚀 A powerful full-stack AI application that enables users to interact with autonomous AI agents performing sophisticated tasks, including multi-agent coordination, image generation, and persistent chat memory—all with secure token-limited access and usage monitoring.

This is **a fully custom-built application**, designed and developed from scratch, combining advanced LLM capabilities with a clean and modern frontend UI.

## 📽️ Demo Recording 

A recorded walkthrough :

- Showcase AI agents in action (e.g. research tasks, creative writing, planning)
- Walk through image generation (prompt to result, including sophisticated scenes)
- Show PGAdmin with database structure & query examples
- Point to local backend logs and token checks (free trial logic)
- Demonstrate real-time frontend/backend interaction via localhost

Recording tools: `OBS Studio`, `PGAdmin`, browser console, and `Postman`/DevTools for API behavior.
